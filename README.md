# MMK Knowledge Base

A comprehensive Python-based biomarker data management system for storing, managing, and analyzing experimental data with a focus on biomarker research workflows.

## üéØ Overview

MMK-KB provides:
- **Project-based organization** of research data
- **Sample management** with clinical metadata  
- **Biomarker experiment tracking** with versioning
- **ROC analysis and diagnostic modeling** for biomarker evaluation
- **CSV-based data import/export** workflows
- **Multi-environment database support** (development, staging, testing, production)
- **Full command-line interface** for all operations
- **Programmatic API** for integration with analysis pipelines

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone <repository-url>
cd mmk-kb
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Basic usage
mmk-kb create "PROJ001" "My Study" "Description" "Creator"
mmk-kb use "PROJ001"
mmk-kb sample-upload samples.csv
mmk-kb experiment-upload data.csv "Experiment Name" "Description"

# ROC analysis
mmk-kb roc-run 1 "Analysis Name" 0.3 --max-combinations 3
mmk-kb roc-report 1 --top 10
```

## üìä Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create and use project
mmk-kb create "CANCER_2024" "Cancer Study" "Multi-center analysis" "Dr. Research"
mmk-kb use "CANCER_2024"

# 2. Upload sample data
mmk-kb sample-upload clinical_data.csv

# 3. Upload experiment data
mmk-kb experiment-upload cytokine_panel.csv "Cytokine Analysis" "Initial screening"

# 4. Run ROC analysis
mmk-kb roc-run 1 "Diagnostic Panel Study" 0.25 --max-combinations 3

# 5. Review results
mmk-kb roc-show 1
mmk-kb roc-report 1 --output results.csv --top 15
mmk-kb roc-model 5  # Examine specific model
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest --cov=src/mmkkb   # Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_roc_analysis.py  # Test ROC analysis specifically
```
